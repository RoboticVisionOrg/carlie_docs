# Carlie Networking Interfaces

The Carlie Platform has two ways in which you can connect to it via networking. The first is connecting the Jetson TX2 to your local network via WiFi; we leave this up to the user to setup. The second is connecting to the WiFi network generated by the onboard WiFi router. 

The onboard WiFi router creates both a 2.4 and 5G local WiFi network. Naturally this WiFi network does not have internet access. The onboard computer, the Jetson TX2, connects to this network/router via a wired ethernet connection. We left the router in the default state for you to setup, which will depend on your work environment. The default WiFi SSID will be of the form *GL-AR750S-xxx* and the Password is *goodlife*.

You may find that the platform does not have internet access when connected to your local WiFi. This is because the TX2 has a wired ethernet connection to the onboard router which will act as the default gateway and which does not have internet access. To overcome this you may wish to disable the ethernet as the default gateway. 

1. Open up Network Settings
2. Open up the settings for the SSID for the onboard router
3. Go to the IPv4 settings and click on Routes
4. Make sure the checkbox for `Use this connection only for resources on its network` is checked

Or you can physically disconnect the onboard router if it is not been used.
