The Carlie Showcase will require you to present the work you utilised the platform for in a 3-5 minute engaging presentation. Your presentation will be assessed by an independent panel of judges. The criteria will consist of:

- the quality of your research activity or you public demonstration, and how you utilised Carlie to help you with your goal; and
- the quality of your presentation - how clearly you articulate your ideas and how engaging is your presentation.

More detailed criteria will be made available shortly. While live demonstrations are always a pleasure to watch they are not necessary and no "extra marks" will be awarded for a live demonstration, but videos are highly encouraged.
