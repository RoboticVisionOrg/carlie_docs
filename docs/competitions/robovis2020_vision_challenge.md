# RoboVis 2020 - Vision Challenge

The Carlie Vision Challenge, to be held at ACRV RoboVis 2020, is a chance to demonstrate your skills as a robotics/vision engineer. This competition is similar to a hack-a-thon style prior to RoboVis 2020, where the details of the challenge and the assessment criteria are released at 9am and submissions are due by 5pm. However, the core of the challenge will involve developing a vision algorithm utilising Python and OpenCV to perform a task with the Carlie platform. The challenge may completed as an individual or in teams of 3 people or less. There are **cash prizes up for grabs**.

We know current events can make you think twice about committing to anything like this - we have gone out of our way to provide as much scaffolding and supportive framework "ready to go" for you so that you can get something interesting running easily. It's then completely up to you how excited and carried away your team gets in iterating and pushing the boundaries on what can be done... 

Any questions please contact James Mount (j.mount@qut.edu.au).  For our Melbourne based colleagues there is the option to work with James remotely.

## Key Dates

All times are in Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST) (i.e. Queensland Time). 

- 5.00pm Thursday 16th November: Nomination Deadline
- 9.00am Monday 23rd November: Competition details are released and the hack-a-thon starts
- 5.00pm Monday 23rd November: Submission deadline and competition closes
- 5.00pm Wednesday 25th November: 1-2 Page document explaining your vision algorithm
- 24/25th November: Submissions will be assessed by James Mount using the QUT Carlie platform 
- RoboVis (26/27th November): Videos of the submitted vision algorithms will be presented as well as the winners

## Prizes
To be determined.

## The Format

The challenge will currently be run similar to a hack-a-thon, where the specific details are released the morning of and submissions are due on the same day. The items to be released as part of the challenge will include:

1. The exact specifications of the challenge and how your vision algorithm will be assessed.
2. A few datasets that can allow you to get started immediately.
3. A software framework with a *\<insert your vision algorithm here\>*.
4. A basic vision algorithm as an example to get you started.
2. Documentation on how to use provided datasets and software.

## The Criteria

Your submission will be assessed based on two factors:

1. The physical performance of your vision algorithm on the Carlie platform.
2. A 1-2 page document explaining how your vision algorithm operates. This will be assessed by a panel of judges.

## The Nominations

To nominate please fill out the following form.
