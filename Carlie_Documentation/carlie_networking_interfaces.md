# Carlie Networking Interfaces

The Carlie Platform has two ways in which you can connect to it via networking. The first is connecting the Jetson TX2 to your local network via WiFi; we leave this up to the user to setup. The second is connecting to the WiFi network generated by the onboard WiFi router. However, we recommend you first setup this router, but you can use the default if you wish. We left the router in the default state as your settings may depend on your work environment. The default WiFi SSID will be of the form *GL-AR750S-xxx* and the Password is *goodlife*. However, we do recommend the following setup:

1. Using an external computer/laptop connect to the onboard WiFi network. Default SSID: *GL-AR750S-xxx* Password: *goodlife*
2. Open an internet broswer and go to 192.0....
3. What settings now Gavin

The onbaord WiFi router creates both a 2.4 and 5G local WiFi network. Naturally this WiFi network does not have internet access. The onbaord computer, the Jetson TX2, also connects to this network/router via a wired ethernet connection. To connect to this network do the following:

1. Gavin insert instructions
2. blah

Additionally, you can connect to this local network via an ethernet connection using the ethernet port located on the shell.
