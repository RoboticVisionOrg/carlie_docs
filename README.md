This contains the central documentation for the Carlie platform. To ensure information is consistent all official Carlie documentation should be included here. The Carlie documentation is generated using Jekyll and served using Github Pages. Please submit pull requests for any updates you make to the documentation.

## Testing Updates Locally
To test your updates locally you can create a local server prior to publishing to Github and Github Pages.

    cd <carlie_docs>/docs
    bundle exec jekyll serve

This will create a local site at http://127.0.0.1:4000
